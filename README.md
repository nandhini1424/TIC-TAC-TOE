## üéÆ How It Works

‚úÖ Play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid  
‚úÖ Player `'X'` (you) makes the first move  
‚úÖ Player `'O'` (AI) responds optimally using the Minimax algorithm  
‚úÖ The game checks for a win or draw after every move  
‚úÖ Shows winning line if someone wins  
‚úÖ Press `'R'` to restart anytime

## üß© Game Features

- **Unbeatable AI:** Uses **Minimax** to always choose the best move.

   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## üß† How the AI Works
- Uses Minimax, a recursive algorithm that simulates all possible future moves.

- Scores possible outcomes to choose the move that maximizes the AI's chance of winning.

- Guarantees that the AI will never lose (it will win or draw every game).
